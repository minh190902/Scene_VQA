# ðŸ’¬ Vietnamese Scene Question Answering ðŸ“–

## Introduce

In this project, We will using easyOCR, vision language models Florence2 and llms Qwen2 to build chatbot for **Vietnamese Scene Question Answering**

To know more about above models, please direct to:

2. Run this command to install dependenies in the requirements.txt file

```
pip install -r requirements.txt

```

**Notes**: you must install Cuda 12.3 or 11.8, so you can using flash attention to speed up your model loading from huggingface

## Run Project

1. Run the streamlit server

```
streamlit run app.py

```

1. Access the application in your browser at [[http://localhost:8501](http://localhost:8501/)].
